## **2. AI Model for Crop Yield Prediction**

### **Proposed Model**: **Random Forest Regressor** or **XGBoost Regressor**

### **Input Features:**

* Real-time sensor data: soil moisture, temperature, pH, etc.
* Historical crop yield data
* Crop type and growth phase
* Location (from GPS)
* Weather forecasts (integrated from APIs)

### **Output:**

* Crop yield prediction (e.g., kg per hectare)
* Yield anomaly detection

### **Justification:**

* Random Forest and XGBoost are robust, non-linear models ideal for noisy agricultural data
* Ensemble methods improve accuracy and generalization
* Handles missing data and feature importance ranking effectively
